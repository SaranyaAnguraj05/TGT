# Travel Guide Portal For Tiruchirappalli District
# ABSTRACT
Travel guide portal provides travel reviews, trip fares or a combination of both. Over 1.5 billion
people book travel per year, 70% of which is done online. The problem statement is to build a travel
guide website for Tiruchirapalli district. The purpose of this project is to provide complete
information about details of the destinations of Tiruchirapalli that are available for a trip. Instead of
searching manually, this portal is user-friendly and speeds up the process of finding the destinations
and packages. After travelling, the Tourists can come back to the site and enter their feedback about
the travel and tourism agency. This system also gives tour-related information like packages, stay
hotels, vehicle information and guide details. Tourists can also book tours at Tiruchirapalli through
our portal. This system also keeps a history of visited places for its users.
It is hard to keep correct records of the Tour Places, vehicles, booking times, available seats, and
vehicle availability under the existing system because everything is done manually. Paper records
are kept of the total number of journeys, and calculations are made by hand, which might have
major inaccuracies. The admin will update all the tour packages using this portal to add more
wellknown locations like Kallanai and the Arulmigu UchiPillaiyar Temple as well as intriguing new
locations and costs associated with them. The user will be able to view and select the finest tour
package for the Tiruchirapalli District using this.
The admin can submit information on the name, price, and description of each trip package in the
Tiruchirapalli District. Tourists can sign up for these packages. After reviewing the details for a
certain package, trip, guide, etc., Tourists may reserve that package. After seeing the booking's
specifics, Tourists can pay with a card by entering data such the cardholder's name, card number,
and transaction amount. Perfect schedule will be made for the Tourists to enjoy their trip/tour
according to their needs. This project is a one stop solution for the users to satisfy all their needs
regarding their trip/tour.
